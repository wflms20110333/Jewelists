# Jewelists

Jewelists is a 2-player PC game, where the goal is to gain the most points by controlling the center of the game board the longest. Games last 5 minutes.

Watch out for monsters and projectiles! They deal damage, and when a player's 
health bar reaches 0, they die and respawn after an increasing amount of time.
Also, kill monsters and gain jewels to build traps and walls to protect yourself
and the center ground!

Enjoy the game and have fun playing!
